# Installation

For using the app you only need **Auraliza.mlappinstall**.

>>* On MATLAB under APPS tab, click on *Install App* and choose the desired app. 


# Source Code

All the other other files are necessary to view the source code, modify and rebuild the App.

>>* On MATLAB open the folder that contain these files, under APPS tab select *Design App* and choose **Auraliza.mlapp**


# Note
Most likely the source code will be updated more often than the compiled app (sometimes it's just not worth the trouble), although if you're facing any issues and believe you're using an outdated version let me know and I'll ensure the most recent updates are included in the compiled app.
